Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by
demyelination of nerves in the central nervous system. MS has no known singular
cause, but onset is affected by genetic traits, environmental factors, immune
dysregulation, and viral infections, particularly by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV).
None of these causes always leads to development of MS, and they interact in
complex and sporadic ways.

# MS is not hereditary, but some genetic risk factors are.

# Genetic immunological differences are associated with MS pathophysiology.
