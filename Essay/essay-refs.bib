  abstract = {Lifestyle and environmental factors potently influence the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), because genetic predisposition only explains a fraction of the risk increase. There is strong evidence for associations of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, smoking, sun exposure/vitamin D, and adolescent obesity to risk of MS. There is also circumstantial evidence on organic solvents and shift work, all associate with greater risk, although certain factors like nicotine, alcohol, and a high coffee consumption associate with a reduced risk. Certain factors, smoking, EBV infection, and obesity interact with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk genes, arguing for a pathogenic pathway involving adaptive immunity. There is a potential for prevention, in particular for people at greater risk such as relatives of individuals with MS. All of the described factors for MS may influence adaptive and/or innate immunity, as has been argued for MS risk gene variants.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We discuss new paradigms for understanding the immunopathology of multiple sclerosis through the recent development of high throughput genetic analysis, emergence of numerous candidate biomarkers, and the broadening of the treatment arsenal. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent use of genome wide association studies provide new tools for a better understanding of multiple sclerosis etiology. Genome-wide association studies have identified many genes implicated in immune regulation and the next step will be to elucidate how those genetic variations influence immune cell function to drive disease development and progression. Furthermore, patient care has seen the emergence of new biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and response to treatment. Finally, the introduction of numerous immunomodulatory treatments will likely improve clinical outcome of multiple sclerosis patients in the future. SUMMARY: Breakthroughs in the field of multiple sclerosis have led to a better understanding of the physiopathology of the disease, follow up, and treatment of the patients that develop relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. The next challenge for multiple sclerosis will be to press forward to model and decipher multiple sclerosis progression, which will help both to develop therapeutics and generate knowledge about mechanisms of neurodegeneration.},

We used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to perform Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, thus assessing potential associations between multiple sclerosis (MS) and two~COVID-19 outcomes (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2~[SARS-CoV-2] infection and COVID-19 hospitalization). Genome-wide risk genes were compared between the GWAS datasets on hospitalized COVID-19 and MS. Literature-based analysis was conducted to construct molecular pathways connecting MS and COVID-19. We found that genetic liability to MS confers a causal effect on hospitalized COVID-19 (odd ratio [OR]: 1.09, 95\% confidence interval: 1.03-1.16) but not on SARS-CoV-2 infection (1.03, 1.00-1.05). Genetic liability to hospitalized COVID-19 confers a causal effect on MS (1.15, 1.02-1.30). Hospitalized COVID-19 and MS share five risk genes within two loci, including TNFAIP8, HSD17B4, CDC37, PDE4A, and KEAP1. Pathway analysis identified a panel of immunity-related genes that may mediate the links between MS and COVID-19. Our study suggests that MS was associated with a 9\% increased risk for COVID-19 hospitalization, while hospitalized COVID-19 was associated with a 15\% increased risk for MS. Immunity-related pathways may underlie the link between MS on COVID-19.},

Multiple GWAS in the last 10 years have uncovered more than 200 loci that independently contribute to disease pathogenesis. As with many other complex diseases, risk to MS is driven by multiple common variants whose biological effects are not immediately clear. This review will present a historical perspective on the progress made on MS genetics and discuss current work geared towards creating a more complete model that accurately represents the genetic landscape of MS susceptibility. Such a model necessarily includes a better understanding of the individual contributions of each common variant to the cellular phenotypes, and interactions with other genes and with the environment.

Serum levels of neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of neuroaxonal degeneration, increased only after EBV seroconversion. These findings cannot be explained by any known risk factor for MS and suggest EBV as the leading cause of MS.},

It is a leading cause of neurologic symptoms in young adults, with no known cure. Emerging disease-modifying therapies aim to control symptoms, with increasingly sophisticated immune function modulation. Though several environmental exposures increase the risk of developing the disease, a large fraction of overall risk is heritable and can be attributed to hundreds of common genetic variants influencing gene regulation in specific immune subsets. Here, we review the history of the disease, the realization that risk is heritable, and the recent revelation of hundreds of genetic variants driving this risk by international consortia studying tens of thousands of patients. Finally, we discuss how these results are revealing the specific pathobiology of multiple sclerosis and how this knowledge is transforming drug discovery.},

In most patients, reversible episodes of neurological dysfunction lasting several days or weeks characterize the initial stages of the disease (that is, clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS). Over time, irreversible clinical and cognitive deficits develop. A minority of patients have a progressive disease course from the onset. The pathological hallmark of MS is the formation of demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which can be associated with neuro-axonal damage. Focal lesions are thought to be caused by the infiltration of immune cells, including T cells, B cells and myeloid cells, into the central nervous system parenchyma, with associated injury. MS is associated with a substantial burden on society owing to the high cost of the available treatments and poorer employment prospects and job retention for patients and their caregivers.},

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated disease with genetic and environmental risk factors and neuropathological features. There are clinical and pathobiological similarities between AD and MS. Here, we investigated shared genetic susceptibility between AD and MS to identify putative pathological mechanisms shared between neurodegeneration and the immune system. METHODS: We analysed GWAS data for late-onset AD (N cases~=~64,549, N controls~=~634,442) and MS (N cases~=~14,802, N controls~=~26,703). Gaussian causal mixture modelling (MiXeR) was applied to characterise the genetic architecture and overlap between AD and MS. Local genetic correlation was investigated with Local Analysis of [co]Variant Association (LAVA). The conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) framework was used to identify the specific shared genetic loci, for which functional annotation was conducted with FUMA and Open Targets. RESULTS: MiXeR analysis showed comparable polygenicities for AD and MS (approximately 1800 trait-influencing variants) and genetic overlap with 20\% of shared trait-influencing variants despite negligible genetic correlation (rg~=~0.03), suggesting mixed directions of genetic effects across shared variants. conjFDR analysis identified 16 shared genetic loci, with 8 having concordant direction of effects in AD and MS. Annotated genes in shared loci were enriched in molecular signalling pathways involved in inflammation and the structural organisation of neurons. CONCLUSIONS: Despite low global genetic correlation, the current results provide evidence for polygenic overlap between AD and MS. The shared loci between AD and MS were enriched in pathways involved in inflammation and neurodegeneration, highlighting new opportunities for future investigation.},

Although there is reason to hope that these discoveries will eventually lead to new preventive and therapeutic agents for obesity, this will take time because such developments require detailed mechanistic understanding of how an SNP influences phenotype (and this information is largely unavailable). Fortunately, absence of functional information has not prevented GWAS findings from providing insights into the biology of obesity. Genes near loci regulating total body mass are enriched for expression in the CNS, whereas genes for fat distribution are enriched in adipose tissue itself. Gene by environment and lifestyle interaction analyses have revealed that our increasingly obesogenic environment might be amplifying genetic risk for obesity, yet those at highest risk could mitigate this risk by increasing physical activity and possibly by avoiding specific dietary components. GWAS findings have also been used in mendelian randomisation analyses probing the causal association between obesity and its many putative complications. In supporting a causal association of obesity with diabetes, coronary heart disease, specific cancers, and other conditions, these analyses have clinical relevance in identifying which outcomes could be preventable through weight loss interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To study the accumulation of MS-risk resulting from different combinations of MS-associated conserved-extended-haplotypes (CEHs) of the MHC and three non-MHC "risk-haplotypes" nearby genes EOMES, ZFP36L1, and CLEC16A. Many haplotypes are MS-associated despite having population-frequencies exceeding the percentage of genetically-susceptible individuals. The basis of this frequency-disparity requires explanation. METHODS: The SNP-data from the WTCCC was phased at the MHC and three non-MHC susceptibility-regions. CEHs at the MHC were classified into five haplotype-groups: (HLA-DRB1*15:01\,{\textasciitilde}\,DQB1*06:02\,{\textasciitilde}\,a1)-containing (H\,+); extended-risk (ER); all-protective (AP); neutral (0); and the single-CEH (c1). MS-associations for different "risk-combinations" at the MHC and other non-MHC "risk-loci" and the appropriateness of additive and multiplicative risk-accumulation models were assessed. RESULTS: Different combinations of "risk-haplotypes" produce a final MS-risk closer to additive rather than multiplicative risk-models but neither model was consistent. Thus, (H\,+)-haplotypes had greater impact when combined with (0)-haplotypes than with (H\,+)-haplotypes, whereas, (H\,+)-haplotypes had greater impact when combined with a (c1)-haplotypes than with (0)-haplotypes. Similarly, risk-genotypes (0,H\,+), (c1,H\,+), (H\,+\,,H\,+) and (0,c1) were additive with risks from non-MHC risk-loci, whereas risk-genotypes (ER,H\,+) and (AP,c1) were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic-susceptibility to MS is essential for MS to develop but actually developing MS depends heavily upon both an individual's particular combination of "risk-haplotypes" and how these loci interact.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore and describe the basis and implications of genetic and environmental susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) using the Canadian population-based data. BACKGROUND: Certain parameters of MS-epidemiology are directly observable (e.g., the recurrence-risk of MS in siblings and twins, the proportion of women among MS patients, the population-prevalence of MS, and the time-dependent changes in the sex-ratio). By contrast, other parameters can only be inferred from the observed parameters (e.g., the proportion of the population that is "genetically susceptible", the proportion of women among susceptible individuals, the probability that a susceptible individual will experience an environment "sufficient" to cause MS, and if they do, the probability that they will develop the disease). DESIGN/METHODS: The "genetically susceptible" subset (G) of the population (Z) is defined to include everyone with any non-zero life-time chance of developing MS under some environmental conditions. The value for each observed and non-observed epidemiological parameter is assigned a "plausible" range. Using both a Cross-sectional Model and a Longitudinal Model, together with established parameter relationships, we explore, iteratively, trillions of potential parameter combinations and determine those combinations (i.e., solutions) that fall within the acceptable range for both the observed and non-observed parameters. RESULTS: Both Models and all analyses intersect and converge to demonstrate that probability of genetic-susceptibitly, P(G), is limited to only a fraction of the population \{i.e., P(G) {$\leq$} 0.52)\} and an even smaller fraction of women \{i.e., P(G|F) {$<$} 0.32)\}. Consequently, most individuals (particularly women) have no chance whatsoever of developing MS, regardless of their environmental exposure. However, for any susceptible individual to develop MS, requires that they also experience a "sufficient" environment. We use the Canadian data to derive, separately, the exponential response-curves for men and women that relate the increasing likelihood of developing MS to an increasing probability that a susceptible individual experiences an environment "sufficient" to cause MS. As the probability of a "sufficient" exposure increases, we define, separately, the limiting probability of developing MS in men (c) and women (d). These Canadian data strongly suggest that: (c {$<$} d {$\leq$} 1). If so, this observation establishes both that there must be a "truly" random factor involved in MS pathogenesis and that it is this difference, rather than any difference in genetic or environmental factors, which primarily accounts for the penetrance difference between women and men. CONCLUSIONS: The development of MS (in an individual) requires both that they have an appropriate genotype (which is uncommon in the population) and that they have an environmental exposure "sufficient" to cause MS given their genotype. Nevertheless, the two principal findings of this study are that: P(G) {$\leq$} 0.52)\vphantom\{\} and: (c {$<$} d {$\leq$} 1). Threfore, even when the necessary genetic and environmental factors, "sufficient" for MS pathogenesis, co-occur for an individual, they still may or may not develop MS. Consequently, disease pathogenesis, even in this circumstance, seems to involve an important element of chance. Moreover, the conclusion that the macroscopic process of disease development for MS includes a "truly" random element, if replicated (either for MS or for other complex diseases), provides empiric evidence that our universe is non-deterministic.},

However, none of these variants are found exclusively in patients with multiple sclerosis. They are located throughout the genome, including 32 independent variants in the MHC and one on the X chromosome. Most variants are non-coding and seem to act through cell-specific effects on gene expression and splicing. The likely functions of these variants implicate both adaptive and innate immune cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, provide pivotal biological insight into the causes and mechanisms of multiple sclerosis, and some of the variants implicated in multiple sclerosis also mediate risk of other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Genetics offers an approach to showing causality for environmental factors, through Mendelian randomisation. No single variant is necessary or sufficient to cause multiple sclerosis; instead, each increases total risk in an additive manner. This combined contribution from many genetic factors to disease risk, or polygenicity, has important consequences for how we interpret the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis and how we counsel patients on risk and prognosis. Ongoing efforts are focused on increasing cohort sizes, increasing diversity and detailed characterisation of study populations, and translating these associations into an understanding of the biology of multiple sclerosis.},

  abstract = {Background: The recently described interaction between smoking, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1*15 and absence of HLA-A*02 with regard to multiple sclerosis (MS) risk shows that the risk conveyed by smoking differs depending on genetic background. We aimed to investigate whether a similar interaction exists between passive smoking and HLA genotype.Methods: We used one case-control study with incident cases of MS (736 cases, 1195 controls) and one with prevalent cases (575 cases, 373 controls). Never-smokers with different genotypes and passive smoking status were compared with regard to occurrence of MS, by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). The potential interaction between different genotypes and passive smoking was evaluated by calculating the attributable proportion (AP) due to interaction.Results: An interaction was observed between passive smoking and carriage of HLA-DRB1*15 (AP 0.3, 95\% CI 0.02--0.5 in the incident study, and AP 0.4, 95\% CI 0.1--0.7 in the prevalent study), as well as between passive smoking and absence of HLA-A*02. Compared with non-smokers without any of these two genetic risk factors, non-exposed subjects with the two risk genotypes displayed an OR of 4.5 (95\% CI 3.3--6.1) whereas the same genotype for subjects exposed to passive smoking rendered an OR of 7.7 (95\% CI 5.5--10.8).Conclusions: The risk of developing MS associated with different HLA genotypes may be influenced by exposure to passive smoking. The finding supports our hypothesis that priming of the immune response in the lungs may subsequently lead to MS in people with a genetic susceptibility to the disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the shared mechanism and candidate drugs of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Sj{\"o}gren's syndrome (SS). METHODS: MS- and SS-related susceptibility genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by bioinformatics analysis based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome data from GWAS catalog and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pathway enrichment, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, and protein-protein interaction analysis for susceptibility genes and DEGs were performed. The drugs targeting common pathways/genes were obtained through Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), DrugBank database, and Drug-Gene Interaction (DGI) Database. The target genes of approved/investigational drugs for MS and SS were obtained through DrugBank and compared with the common susceptibility genes. RESULTS: Based on GWAS data, we found 14 hub common susceptibility genes (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA, STAT3, JAK1, HLA-B, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, TYK2, IL2RA, and MAPK1), with 8 drugs targeting two or more than two genes, and 28 common susceptibility pathways, with 15 drugs targeting three or more than three pathways. Based on transcriptome data, we found 3 hub common DEGs (STAT1, GATA3, PIK3CA) with 3 drugs and 10 common risk pathways with 435 drugs. "JAK-STAT signaling pathway" was included in common susceptibility pathways and common risk pathways at the same time. There were 133 overlaps including JAK-STAT inhibitors between agents from GWAS and transcriptome data. Besides, we found that IL2RA and HLA-DRB1, identified as hub common susceptibility genes, were the targets of daclizumab and glatiramer that were used for MS, indicating that daclizumab and glatiramer may be therapeutic for SS. CONCLUSION: We observed the shared mechanism of MS and SS, in which JAK-STAT signaling pathway played a vital role, which may be the genetic and molecular bases of comorbidity of MS with SS. Moreover, JAK-STAT inhibitors were potential therapies for MS and SS, especially for their comorbidity.},

We used an ensemble of methods to prioritize 551 putative susceptibility genes that implicate multiple innate and adaptive pathways distributed across the cellular components of the immune system.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) varies by race/ethnicity in a multiethnic, population-based cohort. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of more than 9 million person-years of observation from the multiethnic, community-dwelling members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California health plan from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. Incidence of MS and risk ratios comparing incidence rates between racial/ethnic groups were calculated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: We identified 496 patients newly diagnosed with MS who met McDonald criteria. The average age at diagnosis was 41.6 years (range 8.6-78.3 years) and 70.2\% were women. The female preponderance was more pronounced among black (79.3\%) than white, Hispanic, and Asian individuals with MS (67.8\%, 68.1\%, and 69.2\%, respectively; p = 0.03). The incidence of MS was higher in blacks (10.2, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 8.4-12.4; p {$<$} 0.0001) and lower in Hispanics (2.9, 95\% CI 2.4-3.5; p {$<$} 0.0001) and Asians (1.4, 95\% CI 0.7-2.4; p {$<$} 0.0001) than whites (6.9, 95\% CI 6.1-7.8). Black women had a higher risk of MS (risk ratio 1.59, 95\% CI 1.27-1.99; p = 0.0005) whereas black men had a similar risk of MS (risk ratio 1.04, 95\% CI = 0.67-1.57) compared with whites. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the widely accepted assertion that blacks have a lower risk of MS than whites. A possible explanation for our findings is that people with darker skin tones have lower vitamin D levels and thereby an increased risk of MS, but this would not explain why Hispanics and Asians have a lower risk of MS than whites or why the higher risk of MS among blacks was found only among women.},

However, the conclusion was still controversial between studies, and whether the association was causal or confounded is elusive. To evaluate the role of physical activity with different intensities in the risk of MS, we first estimated their genetic correlation, and then conducted two-sample and multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses based on summary statistics from previous large genome-wide association studies. A significant genetic correlation was identified between moderate physical activity and the risk of MS (genetic correlation: -0.15, SE=0.05, P=2.9E-03). Meanwhile, higher moderate physical activity was significantly associated with a reduced risk of MS (OR:0.87, 95\% CI:0.80-0.96, P=3.45E-03). Such association was further verified using summary statistics from another study on overall physical activity (OR:0.36, 95\% CI:0.17-0.76, P=6.82E-03). The results were robust under all sensitivity analyses. Current results suggested moderate physical activity could reduce the risk of MS. These findings help better understand the role of physical activity in MS, and provide some lifestyle recommendations for individuals susceptible to MS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune and degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Telomeres are protective structures located at the ends of linear chromosomes, and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is closely connected with cell aging and senescence. However, the relationship between LTL and the risk of MS remains unknown. METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate whether LTL was causally associated with MS risk. RESULTS: In our MR analysis, 12 LTL-related variants were selected as valid instrumental variables, and a causal relationship between LTL and MS was suggested. The risk of MS nearly doubled as the genetically predicted LTL shortened by one standard deviation (SD) under the inverse variance weighted (IVW) fixed effect model (odds ratio (OR) = 2.00, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.52-2.62, p = 6.01e-07). Similar estimated causal effects were also observed under different MR models. The MR-Egger regression test did not reveal any evidence of directional pleiotropy (intercept = -0.005, stand error (SE) = 0.03, p = 0.87). The Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) analysis also indicated no directional pleiotropy or outliers for any LTL-related IVs (p-global test = 0.13). In addition, a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed similar findings, which further emphasized the validity and stability of the causal relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a potential causal effect of LTL on the risk of MS. Genetically predicted shorter LTL could increase the risk of MS in the European population. LTL should be noted and emphasized in the pathogenesis and treatment of MS.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis is a complex autoimmune disease, and several therapies for multiple sclerosis have been developed and widely used. However, existing medications for multiple sclerosis were far from satisfactory due to their failure to suppress relapses and alleviate disease progression. Novel drug targets for multiple sclerosis prevention are still needed. We performed Mendelian randomization to explore potential drug targets for multiple sclerosis using summary statistics from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (nCase = 47 429, nControl = 68 374) and further replicated in UK Biobank (nCase = 1356, nControl = 395 209) and FinnGen cohorts (nCase = 1326, nControl = 359 815). Genetic instruments for 734 plasma and 154 CSF proteins were obtained from recently published genome-wide association studies. The reverse causality detection using bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis and Steiger filtering, Bayesian co-localization, and phenotype scanning that searched previously reported genetic variant-trait associations were implemented to consolidate the Mendelian randomization findings further. In addition, the protein-protein interaction network was performed to reveal potential associations among proteins and/or present multiple sclerosis medications. At Bonferroni significance (P {$<$} 5.63 {\texttimes} 10-5), Mendelian randomization analysis revealed six protein-multiple sclerosis pairs. In plasma, per standard deviation increase in FCRL3, TYMP and AHSG had a protective effect. Odds ratios for the proteins above were 0.83 (95\% CI, 0.79-0.89), 0.59 (95\% CI, 0.48-0.71) and 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.83-0.94), respectively. In CSF, per 10-fold increase in MMEL1 (OR, 5.03; 95\% CI, 3.42-7.41) increased the risk of multiple sclerosis, while SLAMF7 (OR, 0.42; 95\% CI, 0.29-0.60) and CD5L (OR, 0.30; 95\%CI, 0.18-0.52) decreased the risk. None of the six proteins had reverse causality. Bayesian co-localization suggested that FCRL3 [coloc.abf-posterior probability of hypothesis 4 (PPH4) = 0.889], TYMP (coloc.susie-PPH4 = 0.896), AHSG (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.957, coloc.susie-PPH4 = 0.973), MMEL1 (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.930) and SLAMF7 (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.947) shared the same variant with multiple sclerosis. FCRL3, TYMP and SLAMF7 interacted with target proteins of current multiple sclerosis medications. MMEL1 was replicated in both UK Biobank and FinnGen cohorts. Our integrative analysis suggested that genetically determined levels of circulating FCRL3, TYMP, AHSG, CSF MMEL1 and SLAMF7 had causal effects on multiple sclerosis risk. These findings suggested those five proteins might be promising drug targets for multiple sclerosis and warrant further clinical investigation, especially FCRL3 and SLAMF7.},

Importantly, these nongenetic factors can influence pathogenetic pathways, and some of them can be modified. Besides established MS-associated risk factors - high latitude, female sex, smoking, low vitamin D levels caused by insufficient sun exposure and/or dietary intake, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection - strong evidence now supports obesity during adolescence as a factor increasing MS risk. Organic solvents and shift work have also been reported to confer increased risk of the disease, whereas factors such as use of nicotine or alcohol, cytomegalovirus infection and a high coffee consumption are associated with a reduced risk. Certain factors - smoking, EBV infection and obesity - interact with HLA risk genes, pointing at a pathogenetic pathway involving adaptive immunity. All of the described risk factors for MS can influence adaptive and/or innate immunity, which is thought to be the main pathway modulated by MS risk alleles. Unlike genetic risk factors, many environmental and lifestyle factors can be modified, with potential for prevention, particularly for people at the greatest risk, such as relatives of individuals with MS. Here, we review recent data on environmental and lifestyle factors, with a focus on gene-environment interactions.},

  abstract = {Demyelinating diseases alter myelin or the coating surrounding most nerve fibers in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The grouping of human central nervous system demyelinating disorders today includes multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) as distinct disease categories. Each disease is caused by a complex combination of genetic and environmental variables, many involving an autoimmune response. Even though these conditions are fundamentally similar, research into genetic factors, their unique clinical manifestations, and lesion pathology has helped with differential diagnosis and disease pathogenesis knowledge. This review aims to synthesize the genetic approaches that explain the differential susceptibility between these diseases, explore the overlapping clinical features, and pathological findings, discuss existing and emerging hypotheses on the etiology of demyelination, and assess recent pathogenicity studies and their implications for human demyelination. This review presents critical information from previous studies on the disease, which asks several questions to understand the gaps in research in this field.},

LD-based methods work best when there is a single susceptibility allele at any given disease locus, and generally perform very poorly if there is substantial allelic heterogeneity. The extent of allelic heterogeneity at typical complex disease loci is not yet known, but predictions about allelic heterogeneity have important implications for the design of future mapping studies, including the proposed genome-wide association studies. In this article, we review the available data and models relating to the number and frequencies of susceptibility alleles at complex disease loci---the `allelic architecture' of human disease genes. We also show that the predicted frequency spectrum of disease variants at a gene depends crucially on the method of ascertainment, for example from prior linkage scans or from surveys of functional candidate loci.},

Whole-genome association studies highlight the need to understand the genetic epidemiology.

Multiple sclerosis yields several key lessons including how epistatic effects might overshadow the small effects of genes identified from whole-genome association studies. We reinterpret twin studies and demonstrate the use and advantages of adoptee, half-sibling and avuncular-pair studies. These show that the environment acts at a population level, strongly indicating epigenetic modifications to germline susceptibility. There is good reason to think that such interactions will be within the major histocompatibility complex, in which strong epistatic effects have already been demonstrated. Family-based data in multiple sclerosis are applicable to other neurological traits.},

There is an increasing abundance of evidence supporting a viral etiology to MS, including the efficacy of interferon therapy and over-detection of viral antibodies and nucleic acids when compared with healthy patients. Several viruses have been proposed as potential triggering agents, including Epstein--Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6, varicella--zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, John Cunningham virus and human endogenous retroviruses. These viruses are all near ubiquitous and have a high prevalence in adult populations (or in the case of the retroviruses are actually part of the genome). They can establish lifelong infections with periods of reactivation, which may be linked to the relapsing nature of MS. In this review, the evidence for a role for viral infection in MS will be discussed with an emphasis on immune system activation related to MS disease pathogenesis.},

This cohort provides an update to the only other US nationwide incidence study of multiple sclerosis performed during the 1970s. Medical records and data from the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs for cases of multiple sclerosis who served in the military between 1990, the start of the Gulf War era, and 2007 and who were service-connected for this disorder by the Department of Veterans Affairs from 1990 on, were reviewed. A total of 2691 patients were confirmed as having multiple sclerosis: 2288 definite, 190 possible, 207 clinically isolated syndrome and six neuromyelitis optica. Overall racial categories were White, Black and other, which included all Hispanics. There were 1278 White males and 556 females; 360 Black males and 296 females; and 200 others, 153 (77\%) of whom were Hispanic. Mean age at onset of 30.7 years did not differ significantly by race or sex. Age at onset was 17-50 years in 99\%, the same age range as 99\% of the military. Average annual age specific (age 17-50 years) incidence rates per 100 000 for the entire series were 9.6 with 95\% confidence interval of 9.3-10.0. Rates for Blacks were highest at 12.1 with confidence interval 11.2-13.1, Whites were 9.3 (interval 8.9-9.8) and others 6.9 (interval 6.0-7.9). For 83 Hispanics defined for 2000-07, the rate was 8.2 (interval 6.5-10.1). Much smaller numbers gave rates of 3.3 for Asian/Pacific Islanders and 3.1 for native Americans. Rates by sex for Whites were 7.3 and 25.8 male and female, respectively, for Blacks 8.4 and 26.3, and for Hispanics 6.6 and 17.0. Rates by service were high for Air Force (10.9) and Army (10.6), medium for Navy (9.1) and Coast Guard (7.9), and low for Marines (5.3). Relative risk of multiple sclerosis was 3.39 female:male and 1.27 Black:White. These new findings indicate that females of all races now have incidence rates for multiple sclerosis some three times those of their male counterparts and that among these groups, Blacks have the highest and others (probably including Hispanics) the lowest incidence rates regardless of sex or service. The low rate for Marines is unexplained. This Gulf War era multiple sclerosis cohort provides a unique resource for further study.},

RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of MS has increased in recent decades, and costs of care for patients with MS have risen dramatically. Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals may be at risk for more severe MS-related disability. Multiple genetic MS risk factors have been identified. Factors such as low vitamin D levels and a history of Epstein-Barr virus, smoking, and obesity, especially during childhood, also influence MS risk. Traditionally thought to be a T-cell-mediated disease, recent research has highlighted the additional roles of B cells and microglia in both relapsing and progressive MS. SUMMARY: Complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors affect the risk for MS as well as the disease course. People of color have historically been underrepresented in both MS clinical trials and literature, but current research is attempting to better clarify unique considerations in these groups. MS pathology consists of the focal inflammatory lesions that have been well characterized in relapsing MS, as well as a more widespread neurodegenerative component that is posited to drive progressive disease. Recent advances in characterization of both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative aspects of MS pathophysiology have yielded potential targets for future therapeutic options.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growing evidence has shown that alterations in gut microbiota composition are associated with multiple autoimmune diseases (ADs). However, it is unclear whether these associations reflect a causal relationship. OBJECTIVE: To reveal the causal association between gut microbiota and AD, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for gut microbiota and six common ADs, namely, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes (T1D), and celiac disease (CeD), from published GWASs. Two-sample MR analyses were first performed to identify causal bacterial taxa for ADs in discovery samples. Significant bacterial taxa were further replicated in independent replication outcome samples. A series of sensitivity analyses was performed to validate the robustness of the results. Finally, a reverse MR analysis was performed to evaluate the possibility of reverse causation. RESULTS: Combining the results from the discovery and replication stages, we identified one causal bacterial genus, Bifidobacterium. A higher relative abundance of the Bifidobacterium genus was associated with a higher risk of T1D [odds ratio (OR): 1.605; 95\% CI, 1.339-1.922; PFDR = 4.19 {\texttimes} 10-7] and CeD (OR: 1.401; 95\% CI, 1.139-1.722; PFDR = 2.03 {\texttimes} 10-3), respectively. Further sensitivity analyses validated the robustness of the above associations. The results of reverse MR analysis showed no evidence of reverse causality from T1D and CeD to the Bifidobacterium genus. CONCLUSION: This study implied a causal relationship between the Bifidobacterium genus and T1D and CeD, thus providing novel insights into the gut microbiota-mediated development mechanism of ADs.},

The disease is thought to be due to a complex interaction between different genetic and environmental factors. The prevalence of MS is rising all over the world, due on one hand to earlier diagnosis and prolonged survival, and on the other to a true increase in incidence of the disease. The diagnosis of MS remains clinical despite recent advances in diagnostics and relies on demonstrating dissemination in space and time while excluding alternative diagnoses. The Mc Donald diagnostic criteria, with their recent 2017 revision, are currently widely accepted in the MS community. Although no cure is yet available, many disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have shown different levels of efficacy in preventing relapses, accumulation of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and disability progression. Current treatment strategies include gradual escalation based on clinical and radiological criteria that determine treatment response, or initial induction with high efficacy DMTs especially in patients with an early aggressive course.},

For 18 exposures not suitable for MR analysis, we conducted a systematic review to obtain the latest meta-analyses evidence on their associations with MS. RESULTS: Childhood and adulthood body mass index were positively associated with MS, whereas physical activity and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were inversely associated with MS. There was evidence of possible associations of type 2 diabetes, waist circumference, body fat percentage, age of puberty and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Data of systematic review showed that exposure to organic solvents, Epstein Barr virus and cytomegalovirus virus infection, and diphtheria and tetanus vaccination were associated with MS risk.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have associated obesity with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the role of genetic factors in their comorbidity remains largely unknown. Our study aimed to investigate the shared genetic architecture underlying obesity and MS. METHODS: By leveraging data from genome-wide association studies, we investigated the genetic correlation of body mass index (BMI) and MS by linkage disequilibrium score regression and genetic covariance analyser. The casualty was identified by bidirectional Mendelian randomisation. Linkage disequilibrium score regression in specifically expressed genes and multimarker analysis of GenoMic annotation was utilised to explore single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) enrichment at the tissue and cell-type levels. Shared risk SNPs were derived using cross-trait meta-analyses and Heritability Estimation from Summary Statistics. We explored the potential functional genes using summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). The expression profiles of the risk gene in tissues were further examined. FINDINGS: We found a significantly positive genetic correlation between BMI and MS, and the causal association of BMI with MS was supported ({$\beta~$}=~0.22, P~=~8.03E-05). Cross-trait analysis yielded 39 shared risk SNPs, and the risk gene GGNBP2 was consistently identified in SMR. We observed tissue-specific level SNP heritability enrichment for BMI mainly in brain tissues for MS in immune-related tissues, and cell-type-specific level SNP heritability enrichment in 12 different immune cell types in brain, spleen, lung, and whole blood. The expressions of GGNBP2 were significantly altered in the tissues of patients with obesity or MS compared to those of control subjects. INTERPRETATION: Our study indicates the genetic correlation and shared risk genes between obesity and MS. These findings provide insights into the potential mechanisms behind their comorbidity and the future development of therapeutics.

  abstract = {Observational studies have suggested a suspected association between varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection and multiple sclerosis (MS), but the connection has remained unclear. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the causal relationship between chickenpox which is caused by VZV infection and MS. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the association of chickenpox with MS using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The GWAS summary statistics data for chickenpox was from the 23andMe cohort including 107\,769 cases and 15\,982 controls. A large summary of statistical data from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) was used as the outcome GWAS data set, including 14\,802 MS cases and 26\,703 controls. We found evidence of a significant association between genetically predicted chickenpox and risk of MS (odds ratio [OR]\,=\,35.27, 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,22.97-54.17, p\,=\,1.46E-59). Our findings provided evidence indicating a causal effect of chickenpox on MS. Further elucidations of this association and underlying mechanisms are needed for identifying feasible interventions to promote MS prevention.},
